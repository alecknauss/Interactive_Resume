            <p>With high profile data breaches making the news daily, organizations must provide security measures that build client and employee confidence.  I take pride in knowing I can help plan and maintain software solutions, monitor security technologies and network traffic, and triage technology events.  Through continuous education and training, I remain committed to staying up-to-date on industry trends and technologies to remain one step ahead of cyber adversaries.  Further, it is my focus to ensure information assets and resources remain confidential, undisturbed, and readily available.</p>
