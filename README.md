# Interactive Resume
Hi, I'm Alec! I'm a champion for user experience with an extensive background in information security and project management. I pride myself on defining, creating, and leading the implementation and execution of innovative technologies that deliver a consistent and secure experience throughout the user journey. 

This project is intended to be a personal interactive resume and is strucutured to resemble the format of a traditional resume. With that said, I hope the personal touches help you get to know a little more about myself and my passions.

## Installation
While no specific packages are required for interactiong, this resume can be viewed best on updated versions of Chrome or Firefox browsers.

## Usage
This resume was designed mobile first and uses Flexbox to adapt to larger screen sizes. The hamburger menu is responsive through JavaScript functions; additionally, as screen sizes increase, the hamburger transforms into a responsive horizonal navigation bar. Finally, the contact form utilizes form validation through JavaScript. It requires a minimimum character length for name and messages and an "@" sign for email.
